# _Queen Attack_

#### By _Joey Palchak, Paul LeTourneau, Jake Elsberry_

#### _A C# console application that determines the legality of a chess move._

## Technologies Used

* C#/.NET

## Description

A console application where the user can enter X and Y coordinates for both a queen and another chess piece. The program determines whether the queen is capable of 'attacking' the other chess piece by comparing both pieces coordinates on the board, and returning either 'true' or 'false'.

No UI has been implemented. At the project's current state, the backend logic is functional and has been tested.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ShapeTracker".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.

## Known Bugs
